Close the **CCSM** window. Wobbly windows should now be working.

### Note

* Wobbly windows will not work when the system is started in low-graphics mode. This can happen when booting from the live ISO, and when running in a Virtual Machine without 3-D acceleration.
* *Compiz Config Settings Manager (CCSM)* has issues with the Unity desktop. It is recommended to uninstall it after enabling wobbly windows.
